Exploring The MET open access program

https://acevedla.github.io/MET_API/

HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery

This app was built to provide a way to access information from The MET open access program. This API provides access to the museum 
collection through reference ID's or more accurately ObjectIds. These are numbered 1 to 800,000+ and give you information like the
name of the piece, artist, location or origin, etc. Since most users will not know the ID number system a randomizer button was added.
The information provided by The MET is not consistent and this app provides further feedback to the user when information is not available. 
In addition, using information provided by The Met, the user can learn more about the artist from the Wikipedia API (when artist data is displayed). 
Lastly, a Google map will display when there is data on the city where the piece originated.
